# Majority Element

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

Given an array  **arr[]**. Find the  **majority element**  in the array. If no majority element exists, return  **-1**.

 **Note:**  A majority element in an array is an element that appears  **strictly** more than **arr.size()/2** times in the array.

 **Examples:** 

```
Input: arr[] = [1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 5, 1]
Output: 1
Explanation: Since, 1 is present more than 7/2 times, so it is the majority element.

```

```
Input: arr[] = [7]
Output: 7
Explanation: Since, 7 is single element and present more than 1/2 times, so it is the majority element.
```

```
Input: arr[] = [2, 13]
Output: -1
Explanation: Since, no element is present more than 2/2 times, so there is no majority element.
```

```java
class Solution {
    int majorityElement(int arr[]) {
        // code here
        
        int n = arr.length;
        int element = -1;
        int count = 0;
        
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            
            if(count == 0) {
                element = arr[i];
                count = 1;
            } else if(arr[i] == element) {
                count++;
            } else {
                count--;
            }
            
        }
        
        int temp = 0;
        
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if(arr[i] == element) {
                temp++;
            }
        }
        
        if(temp > (n / 2)) {
            return element;
        }
        
        return -1;
    }
}
```
