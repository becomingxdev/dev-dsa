# Quick Sort

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

Given an array arr[], with starting index low and ending index high, complete the functions partition() and quickSort() so that the array becomes sorted in ascending order.

 **Examples:** 

```
Input: arr[] = [4, 1, 3, 9, 7]
Output: [1, 3, 4, 7, 9]
Explanation: After sorting, all elements are arranged in ascending order.
```

```
Input: arr[] = [2, 1, 6, 10, 4, 1, 3, 9, 7]
Output: [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10]
Explanation: Duplicate elements (1) are retained in sorted order.
```

```
Input: arr[] = [5, 5, 5, 5]
Output: [5, 5, 5, 5]
Explanation: All elements are identical, so the array remains unchanged.
```

```java
public class Solution {
    public void quickSort(int[] arr, int low, int high) {
        if (low < high) {
            int pi = partition(arr, low, high);
            quickSort(arr, low, pi - 1);
            quickSort(arr, pi + 1, high);
        }
    }

    private int partition(int[] arr, int low, int high) {
        int pivot = arr[high];
        int i = (low - 1);

        for (int j = low; j < high; j++) {
            if (arr[j] <= pivot) {
                i++;
                int temp = arr[i];
                arr[i] = arr[j];
                arr[j] = temp;
            }
        }

        int temp = arr[i + 1];
        arr[i + 1] = arr[high];
        arr[high] = temp;

        return i + 1;
    }
}

```
